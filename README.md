# My Curriculum Vitae 

## Project Analysis

### Target User
The primary target user is a recruiter or hiring manager within the tech industry, looking for a quick and clear overview of my skills, experience, and relevant projects. This user values easy access to essential information and seeks to understand both my professional background and the types of projects Iâ€™ve worked on. The website is designed to cater to this need by offering a single-page experience that highlights key achievements.

### Information Architecture
The CV webpage is structured as a single-page layout with a logical flow to guide the user from one section to the next. The main sections include:

1. **Header**: Displays my name, job title, and a brief professional statement.
2. **Experience**: A chronological list of previous job positions with concise descriptions of key accomplishments.
3. **Portfolio**: Projects that showcase my experience, each with a brief description.
4. **Education**: Educational background relevant to my career.
5. **Skills**: A list of relevant technical and professional skills.
6. **Contact**: Simple contact information such as email or LinkedIn profile.
7. **Social**
8. **Languages**

This layout ensures that the most critical information is easily accessible, allowing users to quickly understand my qualifications and how to reach out.

### Visual Design
For the visual design, I chose a clean and professional look that aligns with the expectations of the tech industry. The color palette includes muted blues and grays to create a modern and trustworthy impression. For typography, I selected a bold sans-serif font for section headers to draw attention and a more traditional serif font for the body text to enhance readability. 

The layout is inspired by popular portfolio sites, which prioritize clarity and effective use of whitespace. I aimed to create a balance between visual appeal and simplicity, ensuring that the information is easy to read and the page is aesthetically pleasing.
